# UI Examples Sample Application

This sample demonstrates how to replicate some different types of common BlackBerry&reg; UI concepts for a BlackBerry Smartphone using HTML and CSS.

The sample code for this application is Open Source under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).


**Applies To**

* BlackBerry Smartphone Operating System 5.0+
* These examples have been designed for a Smartphone screen size and not for the BlackBerry&reg; PlayBook&trade;

## How to Build

To build the UI Examples sample application:

1. Click on the **Downloads** button at the top right of this screen.
2. Select **Download.zip** and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **UIExamples** (e.g. **c:\webworks\UIExamples**).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and **extract the contents from inside the top level folder** to your new **UIExamples** folder.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the **UIExamples** folder (e.g. **c:\webworks\UIExamples\config.xml**).
5. Using an achiving utility (e.g. WinZip or 7-zip), package the contents of your **c:\webworks\UIExamples** folder into a ZIP archive named **UIExamples.zip**.  This archive should have the application assets (not a folder containing the application assets) at its top level.
6. Using the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphones](http://us.blackberry.com/developers/browserdev/widgetsdk.jsp)**, package the **UIExamples.zip** archive into a BlackBerry Smartphone application using the following command line: **bbwp c:\webworks\UIExamples\UIExampes.zip**
